It's been a while since I started working on a set of functions to pull data from [trakt.tv](http://trakt.tv). I documented part of the early process in [an earlier blogpost](http://blog.quantenbrot.de/2014/06/05/i-just-wanted-to-rewatch-stargate/), and since then I started aggregating my work into a proper package.

Since trakt launched their new APIv2, I started to rewrite and ehance the package a little, also solidifying the whole authentication business. I have not implemented any OAuth2 methods, but since the purpose of this package is to pull a bunch of data and not to perform actions like checkins, I don't think it's a big deal.  
My main use for this package remains my [shiny app](https://github.com/jemus42/tRakt-shiny) built around it, so I tend to tailor the package around these specific needs.


## Installation and setup

```r title:'Getting started'
if (!require("devtools")){
  install.packages("devtools")
} 
devtools::install_github("jemus42/tRakt")
library("tRakt")
```

If you have a `key.json` with your client.id and/or username ready, you're already good to go.  
Otherwise, try this:

```r
get_trakt_credentials(client.id = "12fc1de7671c7f2fb4a8ac08ba7c9f45b447f4d5bad5e11e3490823d629afdf2",
username = "yourusername")
```


## Let's pull some data

### Search

There are two ways to search on trakt.tv. The first is via text query (i.e. `Game of Thrones`),
the second is via ID (various types supported).  

At the time of this writing (2015-02-16), the trakt.tv search is a little derpy, so search by ID is recommended.


```r title:'Getting data'
# Search via text query
show1  <- trakt.search("Game of Thrones")

# Search via ID (trakt id is used by default)
show2 <- trakt.search.byid(1390) # trakt id of Game of Thrones

# The returned data is identical
identical(show1, show2)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

### Getting more data


```r
# Search a show and receive basic info
show          <- trakt.search("Breaking Bad")
# Save the slug of the show, that's needed for other functions as an ID
slug          <- show$ids$slug
slug
```

```
## [1] "breaking-bad"
```

```r
# Get the season & episode data
show.seasons  <- trakt.getSeasons(slug) # How many seasons are there?
show.episodes <- trakt.getEpisodeData(slug, show.seasons$season, extended = "full")

# Glimpse at data (only some columns each)
rownames(show.seasons) <- NULL # This shouldn't be necessary
show.seasons[c(1, 3, 4)]
```

## Some example graphs

Plotting the data is pretty straight forward since I try to return regular `data.frames` without 
unnecessary ambiguity.

Here is some code to plot the episode ratings over time:

```r
show.episodes$episode_abs <- 1:nrow(show.episodes) # I should probably do that for you.
show.episodes %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = episode_abs, y = rating, colour = season)) +
    geom_point(size = 3.5, colour = "black") +
    geom_point(size = 3) + 
    geom_smooth(method = lm, se = F) +
    labs(title = "Trakt.tv Ratings of Breaking Bad", 
         y = "Rating", x = "Episode (absolute)", colour = "Season")
```

And now the votes per episode:

```r
show.episodes %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = episode_abs, y = votes, colour = season)) +
    geom_point(size = 3.5, colour = "black") +
    geom_point(size = 3) + 
    labs(title = "Trakt.tv User Votes of Breaking Bad Episodes", 
         y = "Votes", x = "Episode (absolute)", colour = "Season")
```

And now we go all statistic-y and use `scale`'d ratings:

```r
show.episodes %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = episode_abs, y = scale(rating), fill = season)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", colour = "black", position = "dodge") +
    labs(title = "Trakt.tv User Ratings of Breaking Bad Episodes\n(Scaled using mean and standard deviation)", 
         y = "z-Rating", x = "Episode (absolute)", fill = "Season")
```

## Now some user-specific data

User-specific functions (`trakt.user.*`) default to `user = getOption("trakt.username")`, which
should have been set by `get_trakt_credentials()`, so you get your own data per default.  
However, you can specifiy any publicly available user. Note that OAuth2 is not supported, so 
by "publicly available user", I really mean only non-private users.

```r
myeps    <- trakt.user.watched(user = "jemus42", type = "shows.extended")

# Get a feel for the data
myeps[c(1:4, 6:7)] %>% 
  arrange(desc(lastwatched.posix)) %>% 
  head(5)
```

|title           | season| episode| plays|lastwatched.posix   | lastwatched.year|
|:---------------|------:|-------:|-----:|:-------------------|----------------:|
|Game of Thrones |      2|       5|     2|2015-02-16 07:06:50 |             2015|
|Game of Thrones |      2|       4|     2|2015-02-16 05:53:45 |             2015|
|Game of Thrones |      2|       3|     2|2015-02-16 04:22:19 |             2015|
|Game of Thrones |      2|       2|     2|2015-02-16 02:52:07 |             2015|
|Game of Thrones |      2|       1|     2|2015-02-16 00:55:29 |             2015|

â€¦and the movies in my trakt.tv collection

```r
mymovies <- trakt.user.collection(user = "jemus42", type = "movies")

mymovies %>%
  select(title, year, collected.posix) %>%
  arrange(collected.posix) %>%
  head(5)
```

|title                      | year|collected.posix     |
