Am Beispiel der jüngsten Twitter webinterface Deisgnänderungen.  
Auch anwendbar auf Facebook webinterface Designänderungen, mobile clients, etc. yadda yadda.

1. `$service` changes interface design of `$client`
2. People complain about changes
3. People complain about complaints about changes, note that  
3.1 `$client` is inferior to their preferred client anyway  
3.2 Nobody uses `$client` anyway  
4. People are offended by people from previous point
5. Arguments about quality of clients
6. Arguments about annoying topics repeating themselves over and over
7. Meta-comments about the nature of such arguments
8. You realize why muting and filtering are really good options to have
9. You are also reminded of how you hate everyone on the internet all the time
10. Go to 1.
